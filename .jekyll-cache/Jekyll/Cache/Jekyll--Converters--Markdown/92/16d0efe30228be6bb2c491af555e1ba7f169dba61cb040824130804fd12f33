  <li>Explain the  modifications made to the Android app to better meet our needs.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="origins-of-the-android-app">Origins Of The Android App</h1>

<p>In full disclosure, for the most part, the Android control app we will use was developed by
<a href="http://www.martyncurrey.com/create-a-bluetooth-joypad-with-app-inventor-2/"><em>Martyn Currey</em>.</a> 
I did however, make some simple modifications to meet the needs of this project.</p>

<p>Martyn developed the app using <a href="https://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/"><em>App Inventor</em></a>, and his article
does an excellent job at explaining the visual aspects as well as the coding aspects of his project.
It is well worth the read.</p>

<p>If you are unfamiliar with App Inventor, it is a Web-based IDE that allows you to easily create
Android apps. It provides a drag-and-drop GUI design editor and a block language for coding
the program logic. It is fairly easy to use and there are
 <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/beginner-videos.html"><em>many tutorials available</em></a>
that explain how to use it.</p>

<p>What did the original app look like on an Android device? Here is a screenshot from the original article:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.martyncurrey.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/BluetoothJoyPad_draftLayout_01_800-533x300.png" alt="" /></p>

<h1 id="changes-to-martyns-work">Changes To Martynâ€™s Work</h1>
<p>The changes are minor. In the original design, when any of the on-screen buttons are pressed,
a command consisting of an uppercase letter is sent across the Bluetooth link. When the button is released,
a command consisting of a lower case letter is sent across the Bluetooth link.</p>

<p>I have retained the concept of upper and lower case commands, however, I changed the command values for 
the red and green buttons and changed the name of the button displayed.</p>

<p>For the red button, I changed the command <em>from</em> â€˜Râ€™ and â€˜râ€™ <em>to</em> â€˜Sâ€™ and â€˜sâ€™. I also changed the display text from 
<em>One</em> to <em>Spin Right</em></p>

<p>Similarly for the green button, I changed the command <em>from</em> â€˜Gâ€™ and â€˜gâ€™ <em>to</em> â€˜Wâ€™ and â€˜wâ€™. I also changed the display text from 
<em>Two</em> to <em>Spin Left</em></p>

<p>For the blue button, I only removed the display text, since we will not be using this button for this project.</p>

<p>Here is a summary of button actions and the data generated for each action.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: left">Button</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Pressed</th>
      <th style="text-align: right">Released</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">Up</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">â€˜Uâ€™</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">â€˜uâ€™</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">Down</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">â€˜Dâ€™</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">â€˜dâ€™</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">Left</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">â€˜Lâ€™</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">â€˜lâ€™</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">Right</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">â€˜Râ€™</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">â€˜râ€™</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">Spin Left</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">â€˜Sâ€™</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">â€™sâ€™</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">Spin Right</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">â€˜Wâ€™</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">â€˜wâ€™</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>In addition to the button changes, Iâ€™ve also added a screen widget to receive
and display data sent from the Raspberry Pi. This feature was added to 
demonstrate that two-way communication is possible between client and server over Bluetooth.</p>

<p>If you look at the modified screen below, you will see that a <strong>Report:</strong> label was added to the
screen. When data is received, it will be displayed next to this label.</p>

<p>And finally, I changed the title of the app to <em>Banyan Bot Blue</em>.</p>

<p><img src="/bots-in-pieces/images/banyan-bot-blue-1/android-gui/updated_app_1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The details of these changes are explained in a <a href="#understanding-the-app-inventor-changes-made-to-the-original-app">section at the bottom of this post.</a></p>

<p>Before looking at the details of the changes, letâ€™s first load and use the app.</p>

<h1 id="running-the-app-on-your-android-device">Running The App On Your Android Device</h1>

<h2 id="getting-the-code">Getting The Code</h2>
<p>When working with App Inventor, you can save your project to a file that will have a <em>.aia</em> extension.
This file may be loaded into App Inventor if you wish to view or modify the project.</p>

<p>App Inventor also allows you to create a <em>.apk</em> file, which is an Android executable allowing you to run
the app on your device.</p>

<p>Both the project file, <em>b_bot_blue.aia</em>, and the app, <em>b_bot_blue.apk</em>, are
<a href="https://github.com/MrYsLab/bots-in-pieces-examples/tree/master/banyan-bot-blue/android"><em>available for download on Github.</em></a></p>

<h2 id="loading-the-modified-apk-into-your-android-device">Loading The Modified APK Into Your Android Device</h2>
<p>To run <em>b_bot_blue.apk</em> on your Android device, you will need to <em>sideload</em> it. <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/how-to-sideload-an-apk/"><em>Here are general instructions
on how to do so</em></a>,
 but you might want to search for instructions for your specific device.</p>

<h2 id="testing-the-app-with-the-bluetooth-test-server">Testing The App With The BlueTooth Test Server</h2>

<h2 id="step-1">Step 1</h2>
<p><a href="https://mryslab.github.io/bots-in-pieces/banyan-bot-blue/bluetooth/bluetooth-test-server/2019/06/15/banyan-bot-blue-part-2.html"><em>Follow the instructions</em></a>
  from this previous post, to pair your Raspberry Pi to your Android device and to enable your Raspberry Pi
  for serial communications over Bluetooth.</p>

<h2 id="step-2">Step 2</h2>
<p>Launch the Bluetooth Test Server on your Raspberry Pi with the following command:</p>
<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="go">sudo python3 bluetooth_apk_validation_server.py
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/bots-in-pieces/images/banyan-bot-blue-1/android-gui/start_server.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="step-3">Step 3</h2>

<p>Launch the Android app on your Android device.</p>

<p><img src="/bots-in-pieces/images/banyan-bot-blue-1/android-gui/AndroidControl.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="step-4">Step 4</h2>

<p>Connect the app by pressing the blue <em>Connect</em> button on the upper right
corner of the Android app. This will bring you to a <em>Connection Screen</em>. It will
say <em>NOT CONNECTED</em></p>

<p><img src="/bots-in-pieces/images/banyan-bot-blue-1/android-gui/not_connected.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="step-5">Step 5</h2>

<p>Press the blue <em>NOT CONNECTED</em> button on the android device. This will
bring up a screen to allow you to select a device to connect to. Select the Raspberry Pi
that was paired earlier from the list of devices.</p>

<p><img src="/bots-in-pieces/images/banyan-bot-blue-1/android-gui/select_pair.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="step-6">Step 6</h2>

<p>The connection screen should now show that the device is connected. Press the gray
<strong>BACK</strong> button.</p>

<p><img src="/bots-in-pieces/images/banyan-bot-blue-1/android-gui/connected.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="step-7">Step 7</h2>

<p>You are now ready to use the app. Notice that the dot in the upper
left-hand corner turned from red to blue, indicating that you are connected.
Notice that the <em>Report</em> is no longer blank, but says <em>Hello Banyan Bot</em>. This
string was sent from the Bluetooth server on the Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p><img src="/bots-in-pieces/images/banyan-bot-blue-1/android-gui/hello.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="step-8">Step 8</h2>

<p>Press the buttons on the app, and look at the console on the Raspberry Pi. You
should the button commands printed to the console.</p>

<p><img src="/bots-in-pieces/images/banyan-bot-blue-1/android-gui/commands.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The following sections describe the details of the changes that I made to the original app.</p>

<h1 id="understanding-the-app-inventor-changes-made-to-the-original-app">Understanding The App Inventor Changes Made To The Original App</h1>

<h2 id="loading-the-project-into-app-inventor">Loading The Project Into App Inventor</h2>
<p>First, <a href="https://github.com/MrYsLab/bots-in-pieces-examples/blob/master/banyan-bot-blue/android/b_bot_blue.aia"><em>download b_bot_blue.aia</em>.</a>
Next, in App Inventor, select <em>Projects</em> from the menu and click on <em>Import project(.aia) from my computerâ€¦</em></p>

<p><img src="/bots-in-pieces/images/banyan-bot-blue-1/android-gui/import_app_project.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>A file-chooser dialog will appear. Select the <em>.aia</em> file to load into the editor.</p>

<h2 id="designer-changes">Designer Changes</h2>
<p>The App Inventor Editor has 2 modes, <em>Designer</em> and <em>Blocks</em>. You select the mode
by clicking on either of the buttons located on the top right of the editor.</p>

<p><img src="/bots-in-pieces/images/banyan-bot-blue-1/android-gui/blocks_design.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here are the design changes I made:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Changed the title label text from <em>Bluetooth Joypad</em> to <em>Banyan Bot Blue</em>.</li>
  <li>Changed the button text for the <em>Red</em> and <em>Green</em> buttons.</li>
  <li>Removed the button text for the Blue button.</li>
  <li>Added a <em>Report:</em> label next to the title label.</li>
  <li>Added an empty label that will display incoming data.</li>
  <li>Added the non-visible <em>timer</em> sensor widget.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="changing-the-properties-of-a-gui-widget">Changing The Properties of A GUI Widget</h2>
<p>If you click on any widget that youâ€™ve dragged into the <em>Designer</em> editor, a <em>Properties</em> menu for that widget
will appear on the right side of the editor.</p>

<p><img src="/bots-in-pieces/images/banyan-bot-blue-1/android-gui/rbutton_1.png" alt="" /> <img src="/bots-in-pieces/images/banyan-bot-blue-1/android-gui/properties_editor.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Using the properties editor, you can change 
the look and feel of a widget. In the screenshot above, the red button was selected and the text
for the button was changed to <em>Spin Right</em>.</p>

<h2 id="adding-new-widgets">Adding New Widgets</h2>
<p>To add a widget, select a widget from the <em>User Interface</em> palette. 
<img src="/bots-in-pieces/images/banyan-bot-blue-1/android-gui/user_palette.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Drag and drop the widget onto the <em>Viewer</em> section
of the editor depicting your design. You will see a new component added to the components window of the editor.</p>

<p><img src="/bots-in-pieces/images/banyan-bot-blue-1/android-gui/new_component.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>For this project, the <em>report</em> component is a label that will contain data received
from the RPi. The Label15 component is the label that contains the text <strong>Report:</strong>.</p>

<p>In general, when making changes to the original project I did not rename the widgets.</p>

<h2 id="adding-the-clock-sensor-widget">Adding The Clock Sensor Widget</h2>
<p>To receive data from the Raspberry Pi, we need to add the non-visible <em>clock</em> widget to our design.
To do this, select <em>Sensors</em> from the Palette menu on the left side of the editor, and then drag the clock
to the center of the editor. You should see the clock added to the list of non-visible components just below
your screen design.</p>

<p><img src="/bots-in-pieces/images/banyan-bot-blue-1/android-gui/clock.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="modified-app-inventor-code-blocks">Modified App Inventor Code Blocks</h2>

<p>To change the behavior of a widget, we need to interact with the code blocks.
To do this, select <em>Blocks</em> in the upper right of the App Inventor Editor.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s look at the blocks for the red, green and blue buttons.
Below you will see the original blocks and the modified blocks
for these buttons. The command values were changed to meet our needs.</p>

<h3 id="original-blocks-for-the-buttons">Original Blocks For The Buttons</h3>
<p><img src="/bots-in-pieces/images/banyan-bot-blue-1/android-gui/orig_blocks.jpg" alt="" /><br />
<em>Original Commands</em></p>

<h3 id="modified-blocks-for-the-buttons">Modified Blocks for The Buttons</h3>
<p><img src="/bots-in-pieces/images/banyan-bot-blue-1/android-gui/update_blocks.png" alt="" /><br />
<em>Modified Commands</em></p>

<h2 id="new-blocks-to-receive-and-display-data">New Blocks To Receive and Display Data</h2>
<p>To receive data, we need to add some code. The blocks below show how to receive
data from the Raspberry Pi and print the data to the <em>Report</em> section of the app.</p>

<p><img src="/bots-in-pieces/images/banyan-bot-blue-1/android-gui/receive_data_blocks.png" alt="" />  <br />
<em>Blocks Added To Receive Incoming Data</em></p>

<h1 id="coming-up-in-the-next-post">Coming Up In The Next Post</h1>

<p>Now that we have an Android app loaded and ready to go, in the next post, we will start
building Banyan components to translate the Android commands into motor actions.</p>
