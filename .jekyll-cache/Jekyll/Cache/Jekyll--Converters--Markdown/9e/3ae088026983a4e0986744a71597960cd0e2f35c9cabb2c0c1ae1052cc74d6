<p>An update of <a href="https://mryslab.github.io/pymata-express/">Pymata-Express</a>
has been released. The API has been updated to be consistent with the
pymata4 API. The format for the data reported in callbacks has been updated
as follows:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Callback</th>
      <th>Prior To Version 1.11</th>
      <th>Version 1.11 And Above</th>
      <th> </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>analog input</td>
      <td>[pin, current reported value, pin_mode, timestamp]</td>
      <td>[pin_mode = 2, pin, current reported value, pin_mode, timestamp]</td>
      <td> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>digital input</td>
      <td>[pin, current reported value, pin_mode, timestamp]</td>
      <td>[pin_mode = 0, pin, current reported value, pin_mode, timestamp]</td>
      <td> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>hc-sr04</td>
      <td>[pin, distance]</td>
      <td>[pin_mode=12, trigger pin number, distance, timestamp]</td>
      <td> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>i2c</td>
      <td>[Device address, data bytes]</td>
      <td>[pin_mode=6, i2c device address, data bytes, timestamp]</td>
      <td> </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>No other API changes were implemented.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://mryslab.github.io/pymata-express/">User’s Guide</a> has been updated and improved.</p>

<p>Here is a list of its major features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Python 3.7 (or higher) compatible.</li>
  <li>It offers a simplified pure asyncio <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/MrYsLab/pymata-express/blob/master/html/pymata_express/index.html">API.</a></li>
  <li>Uses asyncio concurrency techniques for high efficiency.</li>
  <li>It Is <a href="https://github.com/MrYsLab/FirmataExpress">FirmataExpress</a> compatible (link speed runs at 115200)</li>
  <li>Data change events may be associated with a callback function for asynchronous 
notification, or polling may be used when a synchronous approach is desired.</li>
  <li>Each data change event is time-stamped and stored.</li>
  <li>A <a href="https://github.com/MrYsLab/pymata-express/tree/master/examples">full set of working examples</a>
 are available for download online.</li>
</ul>
