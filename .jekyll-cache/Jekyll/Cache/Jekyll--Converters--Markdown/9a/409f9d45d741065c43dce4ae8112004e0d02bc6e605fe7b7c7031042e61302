I"	<p>Before beginning this discussion, I thought I would take the opportunity to 
thank Les Pounder for his Pico articles in Tomâ€™s Hardware. If you scroll down to the 
bottom of
<a href="https://www.tomshardware.
com/news/raspberry-pi-pico-tutorials-pinout-everything-you-need-to-know">this article</a>,
Les provides links for some very beneficial information. I used his 
<a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/raspberry-pi-pico-reset-button">reset button tutorial</a>
that makes reprogramming quick and easy.</p>
