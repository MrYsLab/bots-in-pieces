<p>Here is the very first Scratch 3 OneGPIO Script

<p>In this post, we are not going to get into much detail, but I just 
wanted to share the success.</p>

Here is a short video demo of the Scratch 3 OneGPIO Extension. 
 The script is controlling 2 LEDs on an

see it in action.</p>

<p>Here is a screenshot of the full complement of OneGPIO Extension blocks.

<p>The script was also modified slightly to select a Raspberry Pi and the
pin numbers were changed to control the LEDs on a

successful!</p>

<p>When the code for all the blocks has been implemented and tested, the
code and instructions for its use will be made available.</p>

<p>Until next time!</p>
