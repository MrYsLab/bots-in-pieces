<p><a href="https://mryslab.github.io/pymata4/">Pymata4</a>
 is the latest in a series of Python clients I‚Äôve developed over the years 
 for Arduino microcontrollers.</p>

<p>Here is a list of its major features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Python 3.7 (or higher) compatible.</li>
  <li>It offers a simplified <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/MrYsLab/pymata4/blob/master/html/pymata4/index.html">API.</a></li>
  <li>Uses conventional concurrency techniques (threading) for high efficiency.</li>
  <li>It Is <a href="https://github.com/MrYsLab/FirmataExpress">FirmataExpress</a> compatible (link speed runs at 115200)</li>
  <li>Data change events may be associated with a callback function for asynchronous 
notification, or polling may be used when a synchronous approach is desired.</li>
  <li>Each data change event is time-stamped and stored.</li>
  <li>A <a href="https://github.com/MrYsLab/pymata4/tree/master/examples">full set of working examples</a>
 are available for download online.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="pymata4-replaces-pymata-and-pymata-aio">Pymata4 Replaces PyMata and pymata-aio</h1>
<p>Both the original PyMata library, as well as the pymata-aio library, have been archived.</p>
