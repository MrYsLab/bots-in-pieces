I"?<p>I just published what I believe will be the last of the beta versions for both 
<a href="https://github.com/MrYsLab/telemetrix">telemetrix</a> and 
<a href="https://github.com/MrYsLab/telemetrix-aio">telemetrix-aio.</a></p>

<p>I have reversed my previous decision about support for the DHT and included minimalist support
for the DHT 22 sensor. Implementing DHT support will permit me to use the DHT code as a use case on how 
to add hardware support to both telemetrix and telemetrix-aio for devices of your choice.</p>

<p>One of the main goals of telemetrix is to be friendly enough for users to feel 
comfortable extending it to meet their own needs.</p>

<h1 id="what-has-changed-for-this-release">What Has Changed For This Release</h1>

<p>The features added are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Minimal support for the DHT 22 sensor. Note: only the DHT22 is supported in this release.</li>
  <li>A new command to allow you to set the scan interval for analog inputs.</li>
  <li>The facility to set a differential threshold when setting the pin mode for analog inputs. If you have a sensor
that oscillates between a range of values, and you wish to ignore these oscillations, 
you may do so using this feature.</li>
  <li>Upon shutdown, a message is sent to Telemetrix4Arduino to stop all reports from being generated. 
Doing so helps to alleviate “junk” data being received when an application is restarted.</li>
  <li>Also, some code cleanup and reorganization were performed.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="what-is-next">What Is Next</h1>

<p>I will be writing the documentation for both packages. When that is complete, I will publish version 1
of both packages. Also, Telemetrix4Arduino will be published to the Arduino package manager so that
the Telemetrix4Arduino library may be loaded using the Arduino IDE.</p>

<p>Stay safe, stay well, and stay tuned.</p>
