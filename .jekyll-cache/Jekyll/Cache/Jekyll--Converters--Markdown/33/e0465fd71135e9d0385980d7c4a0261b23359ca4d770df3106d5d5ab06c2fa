I"(<p>It’s launch day, so let’s get started!</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting my new site. For those not familiar with my work,
I have been <a href="https://github.com/MrYsLab"><em>contributing open source software</em></a> to the community
for the past several years and have also documented some of my work <a href="http://mryslab.blogspot.com/"><em>on another site blog.</em></a></p>

<h3 id="what-you-can-expect-to-find-on-this-site">What You Can Expect To Find On This Site</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Small targeted posts
    <ul>
      <li>I can be wordy at times, so the goal here is to keep me in check, and keep the posts short and sweet. Wish me luck ;-)</li>
      <li>A suggested read time is shown for all posts so you can budget your time.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Project Presentations
    <ul>
      <li>A Step-by-step (or better yet, component by component) approach to project implementation.</li>
      <li>Each step presented will include:
        <ul>
          <li>Design decision discussions.</li>
          <li>Design explanations</li>
          <li>Links to fully functional and reuseable code.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tips and tricks.</li>
  <li>Opinion Pieces
    <ul>
      <li>Everything from setting up a development environment, to hardware and software reviews.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So to keep with my pledge of keeping things short and sweet, let’s get to work.</p>
