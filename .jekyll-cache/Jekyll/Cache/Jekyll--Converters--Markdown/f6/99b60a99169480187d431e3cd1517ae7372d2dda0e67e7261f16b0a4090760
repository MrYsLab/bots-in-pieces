<p>With the publication of <a href="(https://mryslab.github.io/s3-extend/)">Scratch 3 hardware extensions</a>
  for the Picoboard and
Circuit Playground Express, the s3oneGpio Scratch 3 extensions project has come to a close (well,
for a while at least).</p>

<p>In addition to the Scratch 3 extensions, <a href="https://mryslab.github.io/pymata-cpx/">a Python API library</a> was developed
to help support the CPX Scratch extension. This API provides a simple to use Python interface
for users who wish to reach beyond Scratch programming and to try physical computing with
user-friendly hardware.</p>

<h1 id="whats-next">Whatâ€™s Next</h1>

<p>I have been playing with <a href="http://arcade.academy/">Arcade</a> and have been experimenting with
integrating Python Banyan with Arcade. The goal is to create a multi-player game
that may be distributed across computers.
Each player would play the game on their individual computers
and connected via Banyan across a LAN. Stay tuned for any progress.</p>
