<p>I was really bummed about my initial interaction with the Arduino 
Nano RP2040 Connect. However, once over the initial hurdle of setting 
things up for development, I was able to port 
Telemetrix to this board and blinked the board LED all 
within about an hour. I am indeed impressed and thrilled to say that Arduino did not repeat the Yun disaster.</p>

<p>Way to go, Arduino!</p>

<p>I had to remove DHT support since the DHTStable library 
does not seem to work for the RP2040. I will be testing all the
0ther Telemetrix interfaces and hope to publish a fully
working client and server for 
this board soon.</p>
