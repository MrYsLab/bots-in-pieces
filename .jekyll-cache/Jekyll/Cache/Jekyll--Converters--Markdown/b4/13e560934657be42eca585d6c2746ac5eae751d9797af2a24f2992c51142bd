      <li>Create the final component - the <em>robot controller</em>.</li>

<h1 id="the-banyan-robot-controller-component">The Banyan Robot Controller Component</h1>
<p>Currently, we can send and receive raw commands to and from an Android
Joypad App. We also can control a robot‚Äôs 2 D.C. motors and 2 bumper
switches through a Crickit HAT. What we don‚Äôt have is a way to connect
the Android App to the Crickit HAT. The Banyan robot controller
component provides that interconnection.</p>

<p>The robot controller will:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Accept raw motor control commands generated by the Android App and
translate those commands into OneGPIO control messages for the Crickit
Gateway to process.</li>
  <li>Monitor the bumper switches and autonomously adjust the robot‚Äôs motion
when the robot bumps into an object. When a bumper switch fires, the
robot runs in reverse for approximately 1 second.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Robot Controller subscribes to receive <em>generic</em> robot control
commands. It translates and publishes those commands as OneGPIO protocol
messages that the hardware control component can use to control the
robot. It also subscribes to receive any report data that the hardware
control component publishes, such as bumper sensor data. It uses that
data to affect robot motion autonomously.</p>

<h2 id="using-a-dictionary-to-dispatch-processing-of-the-gui-commands">Using A Dictionary To Dispatch Processing Of The GUI Commands</h2>
<p>The robot control component is a typical Banyan component, with one
possible notable exception.</p>

<p>The Android App publishes user commands as single-character messages,
namely, ‚ÄúU, u, D, d, L, l, R, r, S, s, and W, w,‚Äù as explained in a
<a href="https://mryslab.github.io/bots-in-pieces/banyan-bot-blue/android/bluetooth/2019/06/16/banyan-bot-blue-part-3.html">previous posting.</a></p>

<p>To determine how to process each command, we could use a long list of
if/elif statements, but a more elegant approach is to place the commands
in an iterable data structure that describe the motor protocol messages
for each command. This data structure is named
<a href="https://github.com/MrYsLab/bots-in-pieces-examples/blob/a0ba269c95e8aabcd90ad8c80fbd83e0a15a1a81/banyan-bot-blue/banyan_assets/robot_control.py#L109"><strong><em>motor_control_payloads</em></strong>.</a>
When a command is received, a routine looks up the command and
retrieves its associated motor commands.</p>

<p>The structure may seem complicated, but in reality, it is very straight
forward. Essentially it is a list. Let‚Äôs look at an element of
<em>motor_control_payloads</em> to understand how it works.</p>

<p>Each list element contains a dictionary item with the command as its
<em>key</em>. Below is the entry for the ‚ÄòU‚Äô command to move the robot forward.
The <em>value</em> of the dictionary entry consists of an array of 2 OneGPIO
messages, one to control the left motor and the other for the right
motor.</p>

<p>Here is the code to iterate through <em>motor_control_payloads</em>:</p>

<p>This routine checks to see if the command is in the array:</p>

<p>This is a lot less code to maintain then using a very long chain of
if/elif statements.</p>

<h1 id="running-the-application">Running The Application</h1>
<p>You can run the application either from the command line or 
automatically start it at boot-time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> There have been some changes made to some of the files since
the previous posting. Please download the files once again by clicking
on this <a href="https://github.com/MrYsLab/bots-in-pieces-examples">link</a> to
go to the repository web page. Next, click the on the green download
button and finally unzip the file. The distribution includes a .zip
file that contains all the files you need to run the application.
Please unzip the file called
<a href="https://github.com/MrYsLab/bots-in-pieces-examples/blob/master/banyan-bot-blue/final_files.zip">final_files.zip</a>
in your home directory.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="from-command-line">From Command Line</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you run the Raspberry Pi in a headless mode using
<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/vnc/">VNC</a> or
<a href="https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-remote-desktop/">xrdp</a>, you can
start the application remotely without having to attach a keyboard and
mouse to the Raspberry Pi resident on the robot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To start all the components from a command shell, type the following
 command:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>bls <span class="nt">-f</span> bbot.csv
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Then using your Android device, connect the Android to the Raspberry Pi,
and you are all set to go.</p>

<h2 id="at-boot-time">At Boot-Time</h2>
<p>To have the application automatically start at boot time, first, change
the permissions on <em>bbot.sh</em> contained in final_files.zip.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">chmod </span>ugo+x bbot.sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If your home directory is something other than <em>/home/pi</em>, edit bbot.sh
with paths to your home directory.</p>

<p>Next, open rc.local for editing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> I am using vi as the editor, but use any editor you wish,
 and make sure to use the sudo command. Now when your Raspberry Pi
 boots, the Banyan-Bot-Blue application automatically starts.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>vi /etc/rc.local
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Directly above the <em>exit 0</em> line at the bottom of the file, add the
following line:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>/home/pi/bbot.sh

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Again, adjust the path to your home directory if necessary.</p>

<h2 id="a-nice-bonus---no-wifi-router-needed">A Nice Bonus - No WiFi Router Needed!</h2>

<p>One of the features of Python Banyan is that if no WiFi is detected, all
the Banyan components default to using localhost or 127.0.0.1 as the IP
address. Since all of the components for Banyan-Bot-Blue reside on a
single computer, they still can publish and subscribe to messages
without the need of having to be connected to a WiFi network.</p>

<h1 id="the-wrap-up">The Wrap Up</h1>
<p>We covered much ground in this and the previous postings. We learned how
to create, load, and pair a simple Android robot control App with the
Raspberry Pi. We learned about Python Banyan and its concept of Protocol
and Hardware Gateways in addition to the OneGPIO messaging
specification. Hopefully, you found this series of articles, both
exciting and informative.</p>

<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>A Disclaimer:</strong> I do not receive any components from any
manufacturer either free of charge or on a trial basis. I purchase
everything I use. All opinions about any of the products I use are my
own. I attempt to be as objective as possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One lesson I learned is that I should have tested the Crickit HAT using
 battery power well before the conclusion of this project. The Crickit
 HAT is excellent for projects powered from a high current
 source, but when powering from 4 NiMh AA cells, as recommended by
 Adafruit, the batteries die within minutes.</p>

<p>Although not necessarily a gating factor, I believe the support
 libraries are somewhat lacking. The libraries do not provide a callback
 mechanism for input changes, forcing one to poll the inputs. Moreover,
 for some strange reason, when instantiating the stepper motor objects
 within the library, the motors are automatically powered. If you should
 happen to have a D.C. motor connected to the pins that support both
 stepper and D.C. motors, the D.C. motor is activated if you create an
 instance of the stepper motor object. What should be done, in my
 opinion, is provide a method call to power the stepper upon demand. Its
 initial state should be off. However, in spite of these objections, the
 shortcomings of the support software are not enough to prevent one from
 using the Crickit.</p>

<p>As mentioned in a previous posting, the Crickit solves physical design
issues very nicely, simplifying wiring significantly. So from this point
of view, I can recommend the Crickit if used with a current source that
can provide 2.5 amps of continuous power.</p>

<h2 id="next-time">Next Time</h2>
<p>In the next edition of Bots-In-Pieces, we introduce the <em>Banyan Bot Blue
Too</em>, where we exchange the Crickit Hat for a
<a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/explorer-hat">Pimoroni Explorer HAT Pro.</a>
Hopefully, the Explorer HAT fairs better when using battery power than
the Crickit HAT.</p>
