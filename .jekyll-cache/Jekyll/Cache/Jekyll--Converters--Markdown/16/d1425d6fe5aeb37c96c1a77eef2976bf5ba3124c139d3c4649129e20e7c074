I"^<p>As promised in the previous post, an <a href="https://github.com/MrYsLab/Telemetrix4Esp8266">ESP8266 Telemetrix sketch</a>
has been released.</p>

<p>It is compatible with both the telemetrix and telemetrix-aio clients.</p>

<h1 id="whats-next">Whatâ€™s Next?</h1>
<p>I am currently working on a server and clients for the ESP32. I decided to create new 
branches for the clients because of specific  ESP32 features, such as touch pins. 
I could have put these features in the current clients but wanted to make an explicit distinction for ESP32 support.
For future releases, I am planningTelemetrix support for the Adafruit Circuit 
Playground Express, Adafruit Circuit Playground Bluefruit, and micro:bit V2. For the 
Playground Express Bluefruit and micro:bit, I plan to support both serial and BLE data transports.</p>

<p>Until next time, stay safe.</p>
