<h2 id="pwm-support">PWM Support</h2>
<p>I have modified the API. The duty-cycle may be specified either as a percentage of 
0-99 or in a range of 0-19990 microseconds.</p>

<h2 id="servo-support">Servo Support</h2>
<p>I was able to implement servo support using standard PICO hardware_pwm SDK methods. 
When setting a pin mode to servo mode, you can specify the minimum and maximum duty cycle 
values to allow you to tune where the 0 and 180 positions are for your servo. You may 
individually tune each servo.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">Whatâ€™s Next</h2>
<p>I am going to try my hand at implementing PIO support for the HC-SR04 Sonar distance 
sensor.</p>

<p>Stay tuned!</p>
