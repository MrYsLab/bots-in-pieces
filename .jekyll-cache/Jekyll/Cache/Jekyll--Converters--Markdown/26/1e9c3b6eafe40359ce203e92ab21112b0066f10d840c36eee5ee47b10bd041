I"œ<p>Last week, as I was trying to solve the mysteries of 
Bluetooth programming (more on that in a future post), 
I received an email announcing the Raspberry Pi Picoâ€™s 
arrival. Quickly glancing at the Picoâ€™s description, my 
first thoughts were, â€œYAAAâ€ (yet another Arduino alternative). 
I yawned and went back to the frustrations of Bluetooth (or maybe we should call it 
Root Canal) programming.</p>
