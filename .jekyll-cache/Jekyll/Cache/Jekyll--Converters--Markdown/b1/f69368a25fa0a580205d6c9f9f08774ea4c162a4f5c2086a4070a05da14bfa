I"b<p>Both Telemetrix and TelemetrixAIO have been officially released today. A user
guide is available <a href="https://mryslab.github.io/telemetrix/">online.</a></p>

<p>So what is next? I will be working on a version of Telemetrix4Arduino (the Telemetrix Sketch) for the ESP-8266 so that
it can be controlled over WiFi.</p>

<p>Stay tuned! Stay Safe!</p>
