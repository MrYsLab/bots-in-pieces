# Success! We Are A Blinkin' And A Fadin' - Just A Quick Update

Here is the very first Scratch 3 OneGPIO Script

In this post, we are not going to get into much detail, but I just 
wanted to share the success.

Here is a short video demo of the Scratch 3 OneGPIO Extension. 
 The script is controlling 2 LEDs on an
[Arduino CodeShield.](http://codeshield.diyode.com/) Click the photo to
see it in action.


Here is a screenshot of the full complement of OneGPIO Extension blocks.

The script was also modified slightly to select a Raspberry Pi and the
pin numbers were changed to control the LEDs on a
[Pibrella.](https://shop.cyntech.co.uk/products/pibrella) Again, it was
successful!

When the code for all the blocks has been implemented and tested, the
code and instructions for its use will be made available.

Until next time!
