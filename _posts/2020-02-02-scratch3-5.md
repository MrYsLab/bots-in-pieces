With the publication of [Scratch 3 hardware extensions]((https://mryslab.github.io/s3-extend/))
  for the Picoboard and
Circuit Playground Express, the s3oneGpio Scratch 3 extensions project has come to a close (well,
for a while at least).

# Pymata-cpx

In addition to the Scratch 3 extensions, [a Python API library](https://mryslab.github.io/pymata-cpx/) was developed
to help support the CPX Scratch extension. This API provides a simple to use Python interface
for users who wish to reach beyond Scratch programming and to try physical computing with
user-friendly hardware.

# What's Next

I have been playing with [Arcade](http://arcade.academy/) and have been experimenting with
integrating Python Banyan with Arcade. The goal is to create a multi-player game
that may be distributed across computers.
Each player would play the game on their individual computers
and connected via Banyan across a LAN. Stay tuned for any progress.
