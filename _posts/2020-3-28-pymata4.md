# Pymata4 Released!
[Pymata4](https://mryslab.github.io/pymata4/)
 is the latest in a series of Python clients I've developed over the years 
 for Arduino microcontrollers.

Here is a list of its major features:

* Python 3.7 (or higher) compatible.
* It offers a simplified [API.](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/MrYsLab/pymata4/blob/master/html/pymata4/index.html)
* Uses conventional concurrency techniques (threading) for high efficiency.
* It Is [FirmataExpress](https://github.com/MrYsLab/FirmataExpress) compatible (link speed runs at 115200)
* Data change events may be associated with a callback function for asynchronous 
notification, or polling may be used when a synchronous approach is desired.
* Each data change event is time-stamped and stored.
* A [full set of working examples](https://github.com/MrYsLab/pymata4/tree/master/examples)
 are available for download online.

# Pymata4 Replaces PyMata and pymata-aio
Both the original PyMata library, as well as the pymata-aio library, have been archived. 

Use Pymata4 for conventional Python programming, and for asyncio projects, 
choose 
[pymata-express.](https://mryslab.github.io/pymata-express/)
