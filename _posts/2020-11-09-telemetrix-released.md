Both Telemetrix and TelemetrixAIO have been officially released today. A user
guide is available [online.](https://mryslab.github.io/telemetrix/) 

So what is next? I will be working on a version of Telemetrix4Arduino (the Telemetrix Sketch) for the ESP-8266 so that
it can be controlled over WiFi.

Stay tuned! Stay Safe!
