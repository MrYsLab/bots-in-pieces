This is going to be another short posting, allowing me to devote more
time to develop, test, and document the OneGPIO Scratch 3 extensions.

Progress since the last posting:
* Extension support for Arduino, ESP-8266, and Raspberry Pi has been
  broken out into three separate extensions allowing for:
  * The ability for multiple OneGPIO extensions to be active at a time.
  * The ability to remotely control a Raspberry Pi from a Windows, Mac, or Linux
      computer.
* The Scratch blocks were refactored for ease of use.
  *  The *Connect* block was removed, and connecting to the extension
     servers is now handled automatically without explicit user
     interaction.
  *  Setting GPIO pin modes, such as input, output, and PWM is now
     handled automatically within the command and reporter blocks.
  *  Block text was changed but is not yet finalized.
* Cursory testing of the Arduino, ESP-8266, and Raspberry Pi extensions
  is complete.


# A Separate Extension For Each Board Type
Each board type now has an extension of its own, and all are
[accessible from the web](https://mryslab.github.io/s3onegpio/) in a
single Scratch 3 editor.

One of the advantages of having separate extensions is that more than
one board can be supported at a time. You can then create a Scratch
script that uses input data from one board to affect the devices on
another. For example, and this has been tested, one can monitor a push
button switch connected to an Arduino, and when the button is pushed, an
LED on a Raspberry Pi lights up. Release the switch, and the LED
extinguishes. 

For the Raspberry Pi, one has the option to control its GPIO pins either
by running Scratch 3 directly on the Raspberry Pi or running Scratch 3
remotely on a Windows, Mac, or Linux computer.

# Refactored Scratch Blocks
 
The Scratch blocks were refactored to be simpler to use. Pin modes are
set automatically when any of the blocks are executed. The *Connect*
block was removed, and connection to the board specific servers is now
performed automatically.

Block text was modified but has not been finalized.


## The Arduino Blocks

## The ESP-8266 Blocks

## The Raspberry Pi Blocks

# Testing
All three supported boards, the Arduino Uno, ESP-8266, and Raspberry Pi
have been tested, but have not been stressed. All blocks worked with all
boards as expected.

# Upcoming Goals
* Completion of the board-specific connection servers.
* Provide on-line documentation for installation, use, and theory of
  operation for the OneGPIO extensions.
* Investigate providing integrated block text translations.
