Release 1.0 was released earlier today, and an online
[User's Guide](https://mryslab.github.io/s3-extend/) is now available.

With this release, you can:
* Control a Raspberry Pi locally or remotely from your PC.
* Control multiple boards simultaneously and have the controllers
  interact with one another.

* Language translation for the Scratch blocks is available. Currently
  English, Brazilian Portuguese and Portuguese is offered. If you would
  like to contribute a translation, the User's Guide explains how.
  
Try it out, and let me know what you think!
