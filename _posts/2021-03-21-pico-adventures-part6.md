[The User's Guide](https://mryslab.github.io/telemetrix-rpi-pico/) 
has been released for the Telemetrix-Rpi-Pico.

I am now moving on to support for Servo motors. I am beginning with attempting 
to use PWM support. I am not sure if I will need to actually implement a custom
PIO version or if the PWM support is flexible enough to provide the timing needed.

Stay tuned.
