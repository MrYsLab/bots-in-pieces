It's launch day, so let's get started!

Thank you for visiting my new site. For those not familiar with my work,
I have been [*contributing open source software*](https://github.com/MrYsLab) to the community
for the past several years and have also documented some of my work [*on another site blog.*](http://mryslab.blogspot.com/)

### What You Can Expect To Find On This Site

* Small targeted posts
  * I can be wordy at times, so the goal here is to keep me in check, and keep the posts short and sweet. Wish me luck ;-)
  * A suggested read time is shown for all posts so you can budget your time.
* Project Presentations
  * A Step-by-step (or better yet, component by component) approach to project implementation.
  * Each step presented will include:
    * Design decision discussions.
    * Design explanations
    * Links to fully functional and reuseable code.
* Tips and tricks.
* Opinion Pieces
  * Everything from setting up a development environment, to hardware and software reviews.
  
So to keep with my pledge of keeping things short and sweet, let's get to work.

*Sneak  preview: the first project that will be discussed is a Bluetooth
controlled, Raspberry Pi based roving vehicle.*
