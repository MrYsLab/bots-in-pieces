# A Little Background
These days, we don't think twice about
[visual programming languages, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_programming_language)
but when [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) came on the scene, it was
truly radical. Since its inception, Scratch has brought the joys of
programming and creative thinking to millions. It may look like a kids
toy, but donâ€™t let that fool you. It is a real programming language and
programming environment that has captured the hearts of children and
adults alike. Beware, if you haven't played with Scratch before, you may
become addicted.

After introducing Scratch 2, the first Web-based version of Scratch, the
Scratch team provided a specification for
[extending Scratch's](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Scratch_Extension)
functionality by allowing a user to add custom programming blocks to the
block pallet.

Shortly after the first Extension Specification For Scratch 2 was
published, I created an extension that allowed a user to program,
control, and monitor an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) board using
Scratch blocks. This program was called
[s2a,](https://github.com/MrYsLab/S2A) or *Scratch To Arduino.* The
original protocol used to connect Scratch to an external application was
a JSON messaging protocol. This scheme tended to be quite slow, so the
Scratch team replaced JSON with HTTP providing a much-needed speed
boost. I was there for that interface as well, with
[s2a_fm](https://github.com/MrYsLab/s2a_fm), a
[Firmata](https://github.com/firmata/arduino) based interface, followed
by its successor, [s2aio](https://github.com/MrYsLab/s2aio). The *aio*
part of its name refers to the Python asyncio library of which s2aio
takes advantage. Over the years I have developed Scratch extensions for
the [micro:bit,](https://github.com/MrYsLab/s2m) and even put together
[a tutorial](https://mryslab.github.io/s2-pi/) for those wanting to
create their own Scratch 2 extensions for the Raspberry Pi.

At the beginning of 2019, the Scratch team released Scratch 3.0 that
includes many improvements over Scratch 2.0. Of course, I wanted to get
in on the Scratch 3.0 action.

# And So It Begins
Building an extension for Scratch 2 was reasonably straight forward.
When I went to explore the
[Scratch 3 Extension Specification,](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-vm/blob/develop/docs/extensions.md)
I found it somewhat bewildering. It is early days for Scratch 3.0, so
this is not unexpected.

I tried following the instructions, and although I could build parts of
the system, I was unsuccessful at adding custom blocks. That is
until I found a brilliant article written by Hiro Osaki, entitled,
["How to Develop Your Own Block for Scratch 3.0".](https://medium.com/@hiroyuki.osaki/how-to-develop-your-own-block-for-scratch-3-0-1b5892026421)

Hiro explains the details of creating an extension, step by step.

If you would like to understand the code structure I am using, read
Hiro's article. I replaced the files of his *newblocks* extension with
my own named *onegpio*.

I encountered some issues along the way, and when I contacted Hiro for
some guidance, he was more than happy to try and help. In that spirit, I
would like to pass on my experiences. 

# Goals Of The Extension
Continuing with my passion for connecting Scratch to physical computing
devices, this extension, allows you to remotely program,
control, and monitor an Arduino, ESP-8266, or Raspberry Pi. In previous
posts, we used [Python Banyan and its OneGPIO 
components.](https://mryslab.github.io/bots-in-pieces/banyan-framework/2019/06/26/banyan-background-4.html)
A thoroughly tested set of
[Python Banyan/OneGPIO components ](https://github.com/MrYsLab/s3onegpio/tree/master/onegpio)
is included with the
[s3onegpio GitHub distribution.](https://github.com/MrYsLab/s3onegpio)


# Setting Up A Development Environment
## What You Will Need:

* A computer running Linux (I use Ubuntu 19.04), Mac or Windows.
  *   As an IDE, I use WebStorm, but a simple text editor will work as
      well.
      > Please note that I do not have access to a Mac so I have not
      > personally tested things using a Mac. However, Hiro has, and so
      > there should be a minimal risk if your development environment
      > includes using a Mac.
* For Windows,
  [install the Windows Subsystem For Linux (WSL). ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
   *   I tried Cygwin, but it did not work in this application for
         me.
   *     All work is done within WSL.
   *     You may use Visual Studio Code in conjunction with WSL, but that
        is beyond the scope of this discussion.
* Nodejs and npm. Any version greater than version 8 for node.js is
  acceptable
  * To check to see if you have node installed, in a terminal window or
    WSL type: 
    
    ``` bash
    node -v 
    ```
    This displays the node version. If node is not found, installation
    instructions are located
    [here. ](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-18.04/)
    For a Mac, the installation instructions are located
    [here.](https://medium.com/@itsromiljain/the-best-way-to-install-node-js-npm-and-yarn-on-mac-osx-4d8a8544987a)
* Yarn. Install instructions for yarn can be found
  [here. ](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-yarn-ubuntu) For the
  Mac, see the node link above.
  *  The guidelines from the Scratch team say to use npm, but I've found
     that npm does not seem to work in the Scratch environment. Also,
     with yarn, you do not need to worry about when and where to invoke
     *sudo*.
* A copy of updated versions of scratch-vm and scratch-gui.
  *  Download the 
  [s3onegpio](https://github.com/MrYsLab/s3onegpio) 
  distribution by clicking on the green
     Download button and unzip into any directory you choose.
  * For Windows, do this in WSL.

# Building The Code
The instructions for building the code are taken directly from Hiro's
article. You do not need to git clone the code, you have already done
that by downloading and unzipping. You need to: 
1. Go to the scratch-vm directory and enter:
```bash
yarn install
``` 
 and then 
```bash
yarn link
```    
2. Go to the scratch-gui directory and enter:
```bash
yarn link scratch-vm
``` 
and then
```bash
yarn install
```      
3. Next, within the scratch-gui directory, start the code by entering:
```bash
yarn start
```    
You will most likely see a lot of warning messages. You can ignore
those. The start takes a few moments, and you should wait for a message
that states, *"Compiled Successfully."*
4. Finally, open your Web browser to
   [http://0.0.0.0:8601.](http://0.0.0.0:8601) Scratch 3 should open. If
   you click on the + "add extension button" at the bottom left of
   Scratch, the very last extension shown should be OneGPIO. If you
   click on that selection, the single "Connect To" block should appear.
   If you click on the drop-down, you will see a selector for the 3
   board types supported.

# But Does It Work?
If you click on the *Connect To* block, you will see an alert telling
you that the WebSocket Connection Closed. That is because we first need
to start a WebSocket server, which is precisely what the [Banyan
WebSocket Gateway](https://mryslab.github.io/python_banyan/#additional_gateways/#websocket-gateway)
is.

## Starting The Python Banyan WebSocket Gateway
Before starting the WebSocket Gateway, Python Banyan needs to be
installed.
[This post](http://0.0.0.0:4000/banyan-framework/2019/06/26/banyan-background-4.html)
has a quick explanation of what Python Banyan is and how to install it.
For Windows, you will need to install using a standard Windows Command
window, since WSL does not support networking, required by Python
Banyan.

You do not need to get into the details of Python Banyan unless you wish
to. To start the WebSocket Gateway, in a Windows Command window or Linux
or Mac terminal window, go to the
[onegpio directory](https://github.com/MrYsLab/s3onegpio/tree/master/onegpio)
in your downloaded distribution of s3onegpio. Next, type the following
command:
```bash
bls -f a.csv
```

This command instructs the Banyan Launch Server (bls) to start up all
the necessary Banyan components we need.

If you now go back to the Web browser and press the F12 key to open the
console and click on the Connect To block, you should see something like
this in the console:

```bash
connect index.js:49
Object { mutation: undefined, TEXT: "1" }
index.js:50
{"id":"to_arduino_gateway"} index.js:73
```
This output indicates a successful connection to the WebSocket Servier.
If you then kill the WebSocket Gateway, you will see a Web alert message
telling you that the connection has closed.

So now we conclude today's post. In summary, we installed the code to
build the s3onegpio Scratch extension, built and started the code,
opened a Web browser to run Scratch with the new extension, invoked the
Python Banyan WebSocket Gateway and connected to it using the Scratch
connect block. What a great start!

# In The Next Post
The goal for the next posting is to create additional Scratch blocks to
set a digital pin to output mode, and to control the pin using both
digital and PWM output. Wish me luck ;-).
